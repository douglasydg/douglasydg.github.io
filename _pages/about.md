I am a Research Assistant at the [Cognitive Engineering Research in Transportation Systems (CERTS) Lab](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/about/labs/cognitive-engineering-research) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, Florida. This lab, led by Dr. Andrew Dattel, focuses on research in human factors, human performance, training, attentional allocation, fatigue, situation awareness, adaptive automation, virtual reality (VR), and intentional insensitivityâ€“related topics in transportation systems, especially in the aviation industry.

My ultimate goal is to improve aviation safety by studying human factors, aircraft accidents and safety investigations, situation awareness, aviation psychology, performance, and flight training.

**Research Interests:**

- Human Factors in Aviation: situation awareness, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fatigue, human performance, flight training.
- Safety Investigations: Safety Management Systems (SMS), investigation techniques, ECFA (Events & Causal Factors), FTA (Fault Tree), FMEA/FMECA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis).
- Aviation Psychology: cognitive functions, and work psychology.
- Aviation Training: student-centered training, Scenario-Based Training (SBT), flight simulators for flight training, and VR for aviation training.
